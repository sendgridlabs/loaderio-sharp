.NET library for loader.io
==============
loader.io is a .NET library for use with the [loader.io](http://loader.io/) simple and powerful cloud-based load testing tool.  Using loader.io, you can quickly, easily, and freely simulate large numbers of connections to your web apps and ensure performance.

## Usage
First, you need to get the library down from the internets and onto your local hard drive. The preferred method to accomplish this is to install [NuGet](http://nuget.org/) and then via any of its many interfaces install the [LoaderIo Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Loaderio).

If you want to build the library yourself, you can fork or clone it and build it with Visual Studio 2013. Drop the file *Loaderio.dll* into your application's bin directory and you're almost good to go.

```CSharp
using Loaderio;

//
```
